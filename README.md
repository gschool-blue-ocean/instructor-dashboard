    <h2 id="description" style="color: #17A2B8; text-align: center;">Description</h2>
  <p> This project provides a firebase authorization for accessing the Galvanize Learn site verifying if an individual is a student or instructor. Once in, the system allows for the student to review their Assignments, Assessments, Projects, and overall status. They can review individualized feedback from the instructor on each project and assessment allowing them to utilize the feedback to increase their overall capabilities and sharpening their skillsets. The instructors can see all of the students within a MCSP that they select from a drop down. They can then click a student's contact card and update their Assignments, Assessments, and Projects. The overall status is auto calculated and not something the instructor needs to complete. They can then add comments, check things as completed, and provide valuable feedback. Additionally, they have the capability to add new students to get their enrollment process started. This will generate an email to the new student telling them to register for a new account. This can be completed from the main log in screen. Once the user signs up they will have access to their grades and standing in the course.

    <h2 id="installation" style="color: #17A2B8; text-align: center;">Installation</h2>

    <p>
    To begin, follow the below installation steps and dependency below.  Once you have installed docker make sure you open docker on your computer.  Make sure it is the latest version and the one meant for your system (Mac/Lynx/PC).  
    
    Create containers and copy and paste the migration.sql data into the data container.  Then paste your seed data in there to create a database.  Verify it seeded correctly by running "psql postgres -U".  Then search for the database using "\dt".  Once you verify all the tables have been installed you can then ensure the seed data is in there by running a "SELECT * FROM student" 
    
    Once this is verified, run docker compose up --build and then use the local host url to view the site.
    </p>

1. `cp .env.example .env` - Copy over required environment variables.
   File Contents:
   POSTGRES_USER=postgres
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker
   POSTGRES_DB=blueocean
   CLIENT_PORT=3000
   API_PORT=8000
2. `npm install; npm i vite; npm i docker; npm i react` - Install all dependencies.
3. `docker-compose up` - Run Project.
   > **NOTE**: After installing a new npm dependency, you have to run `docker-compose up --build` to install the new dependencies on the container.

- `docker exec <container_name_or_id> <command>` - Runs command in the context of a container.
- `docker inspect <container_name_or_id>` - Displays info (including IP address) of a container running in docker.

<img src="/ReadMe_Images/Screenshot_2023-07-21_072638.png"></img>
<p>At this point you can create a new user.  If an instructor added a student then the email will link them up to this site.</p>
<img src="/ReadMe_Images/Screenshot_2023-07-21_072724.png"></img>
<p>As an instructor when you log in you will be presented with the most recent MCSP.  You can select the drop down on the top left to change the MCSP cohort and view those students.  You can click on an individual student to then input their data.</p>
<img src="/ReadMe_Images/Screenshot_2023-07-21_072754.png"></img>
<p>If the student doesn't exist the instructor has access to add a new student by clicking on the Galvanize logo to have the sidebar appear and then click Add User to make this screen appear.</p>
